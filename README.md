# Crystal-Game
Using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript I designed a Crystal guessing game.

The purpose of the game is to get your current score to equal the target number without going over.

With each new game a new target number is chosen, and new values are assigned to each crystal image.

With each click of a crystal, it's value will be added to the current number.

Once you've either won or lost, the current score will reset and a new target number will be chosen, as well as new values being assigned to the crystal images.
